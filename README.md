# CS-230-Final
The final (third) project for SNHU CS-230 Operating Platforms

The Gaming Room, the client, sought to expand their existing Android game, 'Draw It or Lose It', into a cross-platform web-based version. The game involves teams competing to guess an image as it is drawn on their screens. Key requirements included ensuring real-time synchronization of image reveals, maintaining security across multiple platforms, and managing a large database of images. Additionally, the game needed to support multiple teams, unique lobby and team names, and enforce a single game instance per device.

One of the strongest aspects of the documentation process was the thorough evaluation of different operating systems, development tools, and security considerations. The structured approach to outlining requirements, constraints, and recommendations helped clarify the project’s technical direction. Working through the design document made it easier to anticipate potential challenges, such as platform-specific networking issues, and develop solutions before implementation. If I were to revise one part, I would improve the System Architecture View by including a more detailed diagram of the system’s communication and storage components to better illustrate data flow and interactions.

User needs were a central focus in the software design, as ensuring smooth cross-platform compatibility and a seamless gameplay experience was critical. By leveraging React Native for cross-platform development and implementing cloud-based storage and security measures, the design prioritized scalability and accessibility. Considering user needs is vital in software design because it ensures functionality aligns with player expectations, improving engagement and retention. In future projects, I would continue using structured design techniques, such as UML diagrams and architectural planning, while also incorporating iterative testing to refine and optimize the user experience.
